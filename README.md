# Exploratory Projects
This repo is my sandbox - a place to demo, test, and prototype new ideas before they make it into their own repositories.  As such it contains a wide array of different projects, languages, and levels of efforts.  

##Here's what I'm working on now:
### Country Scraper
A project to scrape lyrics from top country music songs and analyze them, creating a word cloud of most common terms (will it be truck? freedom? dirt road? stay tuned to find out!)

### Facemap
Inspired by a tweet I saw once, a project to create a "map" based on features extracted from an image of someone's face.

### D3
Trying to learn the wild, weird, challenging world of D3.js.
